# DMS – Document-Based Query & Retrieval System

DMS (Document Management System) is a Flask-based backend application that allows users to query approved documents and receive answers strictly grounded in retrieved document content.

The system ensures controlled responses, citation tracking, and query logging, making it suitable for enterprise knowledge systems and GenAI-based RAG architectures.
